# EC for twitter coronavirus

Brief Overview: I chose to look at the #genshinimpact, a popular game back in the pandemic and a game I used to play a lot of. 

Reason why I think it's 'interesting': During the pandemic, Genshin Impact debuted and it gained a lot of attention. I think this was the go to game for people stuck in quarantine and social isolation. I also think this game reached a massive audience, connecting people together. 

Fun fact: I met my first friends from the 5C after getting accepted to Mudd ED thanks to this game. 

And although I don't play the game at all anymore, I still have my account and memories I can look back on.
