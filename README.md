# EC for twitter coronavirus

Brief Overview: I chose to look at the #covid19.

The reason why I chose to look at #covid19 is because back then (and I guess now), covid19 is a more popular/widely used term thatn coronavirus; at least amongst the youth in SoCal in my opinion. Although I don't think this will neecessarily change a lot of things, I do think it is an interesting term, related to our og term, to look into.
