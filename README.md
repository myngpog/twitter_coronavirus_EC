# EC for twitter coronavirus

Brief Overview: I chose to look at the #valorant.

The reason why I looked at #valorant is that during quarantine, it was (one of) the most popular game online and everyone I knew was playing it or at least have heard of it. I believe that the unique circumstance of the pandemic made it more popular than it was originally intended to be; which was why I think it would be interesting to look at the hashtag count for it over the year of 2020; peak pandemic time.
